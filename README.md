Our client was an Affiliate Marketer named Earning Empire. The company is comprised of Accounts holding Brands. Brands within themselves contain numerous campaigns. Customers would go to sites or apps and click on an advert that takes them to online gambling sites. That campaign would then earn commission per click. 
From a business prospect, the client wants to know which campaign is earning the most here from earnings per click. The more clicks you have; it usually translates to more revenue. Through analysis, we can see which campaign generated the most Commission and so we can see most Commission, but then we can also factor it by earnings per click and go well. 
Visualizing these streams of campaigns, it might help people understand what campaigns active and which ones have folded. We can identify some campaigns that are overperforming and here are some campaigns that are underperforming.
To help the client, to increase revenue we would need to find campaigns that earn more with less traffic. With our new visualization of the data, we would see very quickly month by month and see that a program probably could have made X amount in January and 0 amount in February. Yet there is still lots of traffic being sent to it. This is what affiliates need to see more. Possible solutions would be redirecting to a new site if one site is not profitable.
